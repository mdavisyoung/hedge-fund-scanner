# 3. For Streamlit Cloud deployment:
#    - Add these as secrets in Streamlit Cloud settings
#    - Do NOT include them in your code
# 4. For GitHub Actions:
#    - Add XAI_API_KEY as a repository secret
#    - Settings → Secrets → Actions → New repository secret
# 5. Paper Trading vs Live:
#    - Paper trading is FREE and uses fake money ($100,000 starting balance)
#    - Always test with paper trading first (recommended: 1-3 months)
#    - Switch to live trading only after proven profitability
